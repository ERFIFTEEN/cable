> Cable: CMake Bootstrap Library

Cable is a set of CMake modules and scripts containing common patterns used
in CMake-based C++ projects. The design goal is to be pragmatic rather than
generic so the number of provided options is minimal. The Cable modules are
independent so it is easy to use them individually.

## Install

### As git submodule

Include the Cable library as git submodule in your project. The suggested
submodule location is `cmake/cable` relative to your project root directory.

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/ethereum/cable cmake/cable
```

## Usage

Cable contains the `bootstrap.cmake` file that initializes the library.
Start by including this file in your main `CMakeLists.txt` from Cable submodule
or any other location. The `bootstrap.cmake` must be included before
the `project()` command. After that, you can include and use other
Cable modules.

### Example

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)

include(cmake/cable/bootstrap.cmake)
include(CableBuildType)

project(tothemoon)

cable_set_build_type(DEFAULT RelWithDebInfo CONFIGURATION_TYPES Debug Release RelWithDebInfo)
```
